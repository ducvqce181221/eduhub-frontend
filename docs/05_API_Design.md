# 05 — API Design
**Pre-Coding Documentation**  
*Project:* EduHub | *Version:* 1.5 | *Status:* Refined before coding

> **Mirrored from `eduhub-backend`.** This file is a read-only reference — the backend
> repo owns the source of truth. When the API changes, pull the update from
> `eduhub-backend/docs/05_API_Design.md` rather than editing endpoints here directly.
> Longer term, prefer generating frontend types straight from the live Swagger JSON
> (`/api/docs-json`) with a tool like `openapi-typescript`, so this file only needs to stay
> human-readable rather than perfectly byte-for-byte in sync.

## 1. API Principles & Standard Envelopes
- **Base path:** `/api/v1`
- RESTful resource-oriented URLs.
- Bearer JWT authentication for protected endpoints.
- Strict DTO validation with NestJS `ValidationPipe` (`whitelist: true`, `forbidNonWhitelisted: true`, `transform: true`).
- Swagger/OpenAPI documentation auto-generated at `/api/docs`.

### 1.1 Standard Response Formats

**Success Response Envelope (Single Resource):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "title": "Course Title"
  }
}
```

**Success Response Envelope (Paginated Collection):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "data": [ ... ],
  "meta": {
    "page": 1,
    "limit": 10,
    "total": 45,
    "totalPages": 5
  }
}
```

**Error Response Envelope:**
```json
{
  "success": false,
  "statusCode": 400,
  "message": ["passScore must not be greater than 100"],
  "error": "Bad Request",
  "timestamp": "2026-08-26T08:30:00.000Z",
  "path": "/api/v1/lessons/uuid/quiz"
}
```

### 1.2 DTO & OpenAPI Schema Conventions (Explicit Typing)
- **Dev Engine Architecture:** The development environment uses `tsx` (`esbuild`) for instant server boot and hot-reload. Because `esbuild` does not run TypeScript AST transformer plugins (such as `@nestjs/swagger/plugin`), all DTOs and Controller methods must provide explicit OpenAPI definitions:
  - **DTO Properties:** Explicitly declare `type`, `example`, and `description` in `@ApiProperty({ type: String, example: "...", description: "..." })` and `@ApiPropertyOptional({ type: Number, ... })`.
  - **Controller Methods:** Explicitly annotate mutation endpoints with `@ApiBody({ type: TargetDto })`.
  - **Defensive Service Validation:** Service layer methods must validate that required DTO payloads are present, converting malformed/missing payloads into standard `400 Bad Request` exceptions.
  - **Benefits:** Guarantees 100% reliable Swagger UI generation (`/api/docs`), robust type-safe code generation for the frontend (`/api/docs-json`), and rich interactive documentation across all runtimes.
